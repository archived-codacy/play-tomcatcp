## Usage

### Base

Add the dependency to your `build.sbt`:

* `"com.codacy" %% "codacy-tomcatcp" % "<latest-version>"`

### PlayFramework

1. Add the dependency to your `build.sbt`:

* `"com.codacy" %% "codacy-tomcatcp-play243" % "<latest-version>"`
    
**OR**    
    
* `"com.codacy" %% "codacy-tomcatcp-play24" % "<latest-version>"`
    
**OR**    
    
* `"com.codacy" %% "codacy-tomcatcp-play25" % "<latest-version>"`
    
**OR**    
    
* `"com.codacy" %% "codacy-tomcatcp-play26" % "<latest-version>"`

2. Now add the following lines to your `conf/application.conf`:

```
play.modules.disabled += "play.api.db.HikariCPModule"
play.modules.enabled += "com.codacy.tomcatcp.play.TomcatCPModule"
```

>This will disable Hikari and enable the Tomcat plugin.

### Metrics

* `"com.codacy" %% "codacy-tomcatcp-dropwizard3" % "<latest-version>"`
    
**OR**    
    
* `"com.codacy" %% "codacy-tomcatcp-dropwizard4" % "<latest-version>"`

### Custom Options

If you have any problems with the connection validation query, defining a custom validator might help.

For example if you define a `validatorClassName` as described bellow it will be used instead of the default.

We have `com.codacy.tomcatcp.validators.TomcatValidator` that uses a timeout
to avoid blocking for long times while validating the connection.

### Example Configuration:

```
driver = org.example.Driver
url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/exampledb"
username = "example"
password = "example"

tomcatcp {
  testOnBorrow = true
  validationInterval = 5000
  testWhileIdle = false
  validatorClassName = "com.codacy.tomcatcp.validators.TomcatValidator"

  initialSize = 2
  minIdle = 2
  maxActive = 5
  maxIdle = 5
}
```

### Additional configuration

For detailed descriptions on each option check the [Tomcat JDBC CP Configuration](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html#Attributes) page.
